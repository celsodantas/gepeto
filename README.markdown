# Gepeto

Gepeto stand for: *G*ame *E*ngine for academic *P*roporse (and Gepeto is the Pinoccio father! =D )
This is one of my academic projects. I created it just to show some shaders I've implemented and try to motivate some people from my college to lear about game engine programming.

I'll try to keep the code simple and clean, so newcomers can undestand how it works.

# What's next?

I don't know. As I love C/C++ programming, time to time I'll probably improve this and add more functionality. Right know it's just a pile of code that runs fine but you can't create a game from it. It's still in a very early state.

This version of the code is a completely rewrite. I was really unsatisfied with the code quality so if you want to see something working, check the repo history.

# Compability

I've only tested it on my Mac OS X 10.7. I'll try to be platform independent, but haven't tryied on Windows/Linux yet.
